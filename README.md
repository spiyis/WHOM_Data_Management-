This is a data management system I created using tkinter. It is used by a local nonprofit organization's pregnancy center to streamline data entry and analysis, as prior to this program,
all data work was being done by hand. Employees had expressed concerns about accesibility of volunteers, as many were wary of using Excel. Therefore, there was a need to
create a program that connected to an Excel spreadhsheet that could then be used by professional staff members.
